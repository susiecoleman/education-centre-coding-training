                Bees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants, known for their role in pollination and, 
                in the case of the best-known bee species, the European honey bee, for producing honey and beeswax. 
                Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea and are presently considered a clade, 
                called Anthophila. There are nearly <span class="number-style">20,000</span> known species of bees in seven recognized biological families.
                 They are found on every continent except Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants.

                Some species including honey bees, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumblebee">bumblebees</a>, and stingless bees live 
                socially in colonies. Bees are adapted for feeding on nectar and pollen, the former primarily as an energy source and the latter 
                primarily for protein and other nutrients. Most pollen is used as food for larvae. Bee pollination is important both ecologically
                 and commercially; the decline in wild bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees.

                Bees range in size from tiny stingless bee species whose workers are less than <span class="number-style">2</span> millimetres 
                (<span class="number-style">0.08</span> in) long, to Megachile pluto, the
                 largest species of leafcutter bee, whose females can attain a length of <span class="number-style">39</span> millimetres 
                 (<span class="number-style">1.54</span> in). The most common bees in the Northern 
                 Hemisphere are the Halictidae, or sweat bees, but they are small and often mistaken for wasps or flies. Vertebrate predators of bees 
                 include birds such as bee-eaters; insect predators include beewolves and dragonflies.
